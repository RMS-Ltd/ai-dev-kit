## Overview

This story produces a **practical versioning cookbook** for the RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD schema, turning the dev-kit versioning policy and framework docs into **concrete, copyable examples** for other projects.

It focuses on:

- Realistic scenarios (new epic, new story, new task, bugfix, hotfix, parallel work)
- Clear mapping between **Kanban → Versioning → RW**
- Guidance that is **safe to copy** into external projects

---

## Goal

Provide a **versioning cookbook** with worked examples that shows:

- How to select the right version components for common scenarios
- How to handle parallel epics/stories safely
- How to represent bugfixes and hotfixes
- How to keep Kanban, versioning, and RW aligned

---

## Tasks

### E3:S02:T06 – Investigate and harden changelog ordering process

**Status:** IN PROGRESS
**Note:** This task is marked as PERPETUAL because changelog ordering is an ongoing maintenance concern. While the initial investigation and hardening work was completed in v0.3.2.6+1, the changelog must be continuously maintained to ensure canonical ordering is preserved. This task remains active to track any future ordering violations and ensure the process continues to work correctly.

**Input:**  
- Issue: Changelog entries appeared in incorrect order (v0.3.2.4+1 before v0.2.4.9+3)
- Canonical ordering principle: Versions must be ordered by version number (RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD)
- Policy: `docs/architecture/standards-and-adrs/dev-kit-versioning-policy.md` Section 8

**Deliverable:**  
- Root cause analysis of how changelog ordering violation occurred
- Process improvements to prevent future violations
- Validation/automation recommendations
- Ongoing maintenance of changelog canonical ordering

**Approach:**
1. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Investigate how RW Step 4 (Update Main Changelog) handles version ordering
   - Check if RW Step 4 reads existing changelog entries before inserting new entry
   - Verify if RW Step 4 compares version numbers to determine insertion point
   - Document the exact sequence that led to incorrect ordering

2. **Process Gap Analysis:**
   - Identify missing validation steps in RW workflow
   - Check if changelog ordering is validated in RW Step 8 (Run Validators)
   - Determine if manual process is required or if automation is possible

3. **Prevention Strategy:**
   - Update RW Step 4 to explicitly validate version ordering
   - Add changelog ordering validation to RW Step 8
   - Create automated validation script if needed
   - Update RW documentation with ordering requirements

4. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Update RW Step 4 instructions to include ordering validation
   - Add changelog ordering to validation checklist
   - Document canonical ordering requirements clearly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Root cause analysis completed and documented ✅
- [x] Process gaps identified ✅
- [x] Prevention strategy defined ✅
- [x] RW Step 4 updated with ordering validation ✅
- [x] Validation added to RW Step 8 ✅
- [x] Documentation updated with ordering requirements ✅
- [x] Prevention measures implemented ✅

### E3:S02:T07 – Create dual-versioning guide for package manager compatibility

**Input:**  
- User requirement: Projects using `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD` schema need SemVer (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) for package managers (npm, pub.dev, PyPI, etc.)
- Issue identified: `been-there` project agent created sync script, indicating need for canonical guidance
- Framework documentation: `packages/frameworks/numbering & versioning/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`

**Deliverable:**  
- `docs/architecture/standards-and-adrs/dual-versioning-package-managers.md` - Comprehensive guide for managing dual versioning
- Updated `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` with package manager compatibility warning
- Updated framework README with dual-versioning reference

**Approach:**

   - Explain incompatibility between `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD` and SemVer requirements
   - Provide examples of package manager requirements (npm, pub.dev, PyPI, Maven)
   - Show real-world scenario (been-there project)

2. **Define Mapping Strategies:**
   - Strategy 1: Direct Mapping (MAJOR=RC, MINOR=EPIC, PATCH=STORY*100+TASK)
   - Strategy 2: Compact Mapping (includes BUILD in PATCH)
   - Strategy 3: Independent SemVer (for public releases)
   - Strategy 4: BUILD-Preserving Mapping (Recommended) - `MINOR = EPIC * 100 + STORY`, `PATCH = TASK * 100 + BUILD`
   - Strategy 5: Hybrid Approach (combines strategies)

3. **Implementation Patterns:**
   - Pattern 1: Single Source of Truth (Python example)
   - Pattern 2: Sync Script (any language)
   - Pattern 3: Build-Time Generation (CI/CD)

4. **Code Examples:**
   - Python implementation (Strategy 4)
   - Dart/Flutter implementation (pubspec.yaml)
   - Sync script examples
   - Validation scripts

5. **Best Practices:**
   - Single source of truth principle
   - Automation recommendations
   - Validation requirements
   - Integration with Release Workflow

6. **Update Framework Documentation:**
   - Add warning to `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` about package manager compatibility
   - Update framework README with dual-versioning reference
   - Update dev-kit versioning policy with dual-versioning reference

**Key Requirements:**
- Use mathematical formula `EPIC * 100 + STORY` (not string concatenation) to avoid ambiguity
- Preserve BUILD number in SemVer when possible (Strategy 4)
- Provide clear, copyable examples for different languages
- Document all mapping strategies with pros/cons

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Dual-versioning guide created with comprehensive mapping strategies
- [ ] Strategy 4 (BUILD-Preserving Mapping) documented as recommended approach
- [ ] Mathematical formula `EPIC * 100 + STORY` used (not string concatenation)
- [ ] Implementation patterns provided (Python, Dart/Flutter, sync scripts)
- [ ] Code examples included for all patterns
- [ ] Best practices and validation documented
- [ ] Framework documentation updated with references
- [ ] Guide linked from Implementation Guide and framework README

### E3:S02:T08 – Audit dual-versioning application across packages and propose strategy

**Status:** IN PROGRESS

**Input:**  
- Dual-versioning guide (`dual-versioning-package-managers.md`)  
- Current package version metadata (if any) in each package  
- Release history and SemVer expectations for package managers  

**Deliverable:**  
- ✅ **Audit Report:** `T08-dual-versioning-package-audit-report.md` - Comprehensive audit covering:
  - All packages inventoried (Workflow Management: 2.0.0, Numbering & Versioning: 2.0.0, Kanban: 1.0.0, Debug Path: 1.0.0, Doc Lifecycle: 1.0.0)
  - No package manifest files found (no `package.json`, `pubspec.yaml`, `setup.py`, `pyproject.toml`)
  - Dual-versioning strategy analysis: NOT applicable for current documentation-only packages
  - SemVer continuity problem validated: Derived SemVer from RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD would create non-continuous sequences
  - Proposed solution: Independent SemVer for packages (current approach is correct)
  - Recommendations for current packages and future published packages
  - Guidance for adopting projects on when to use dual-versioning vs. independent SemVer


**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Current packages use independent SemVer in README (appropriate for documentation packages)
- ❌ No package manifest files exist (not needed for documentation-only packages)
- ⚠️ Dual-versioning is NOT necessary for documentation-only packages
- ✅ Independent SemVer is recommended for published packages (avoids continuity issues)
- ✅ SemVer continuity concern validated - derived SemVer would create non-continuous sequences

**Recommendations:**
- Continue current approach for documentation packages (independent SemVer in README)
- Use independent SemVer for future published packages (separate from project version)
- Update dual-versioning guide to clarify when to use dual-versioning vs. independent SemVer

**Dependencies:** None (uses existing policy and guide)  
**Blocker:** None  
**Parallel Development Candidacy:** Safe  

**Approach:**  
1. ✅ Inventoried all packages and located any existing SemVer fields (none found - no package manifest files)
2. ✅ Recorded current SemVer values in README files (Workflow Management: 2.0.0, Numbering & Versioning: 2.0.0, Kanban: 1.0.0, Debug Path: 1.0.0, Doc Lifecycle: 1.0.0)
3. ✅ Evaluated applicability of dual-versioning mapping strategies:
   - Assessed that derived SemVer would disrupt version continuity (validated user concern)
   - Determined that independent SemVer track is appropriate for current packages
4. ✅ Proposed package-specific strategy:
   - Current packages: Continue independent SemVer in README (no changes needed)
   - Future published packages: Use independent SemVer with project version reference in metadata
   - Guidance provided on when to use dual-versioning vs. independent SemVer
5. ✅ Summarized findings and recommendations in comprehensive audit report

- Step-2.5 should reference the PVW agent execution guide for detailed instructions
- Step-2.5 should be optional (required: false) but enabled by default
- Step-2.5 should handle the case where no packages have changed (skip gracefully)

**Dependencies:** E3:S02:T09 (completed)  
**Blocker:** None  
**Parallel Development Candidacy:** Safe  

**Approach:**  
1. Update TODO list in RW guide to include `rw-step-2.5`
