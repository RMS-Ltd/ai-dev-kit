# Release v0.2.1.1+5

**Release Date:** 2025-12-02 00:00:00 UTC

**Epic / Story / Task:** Epic 2, Story 1, Task 3  
**Type:** 📚 Documentation

---

## 📋 Summary

This release completes **Task 3: Align `.cursorrules` RW trigger section with dev-kit policy**. The cursorrules RW trigger section has been updated with dev-kit-specific examples and aligned with the dev-kit versioning policy, making it clear how to use the template in the dev-kit repository itself.

---

## 🎯 What's Changed

### Task 3 Completion

- ✅ **File Paths Section:** Added dev-kit examples for all paths:
  - Version file: `src/fynd_deals/version.py` (legacy path, acceptable for now)
  - Changelog Archive: `docs/changelog-and-release-notes/changelog-archive/`
  - Kanban Board: `docs/project-management/kanban/_index.md` or `kanban-board.md`
  - Epic Docs: `docs/project-management/kanban/epics/Epic-{epic}.md`
  - Story Docs: `docs/project-management/kanban/epics/Epic-{epic}/stories/Story-{story}-*.md`
  - Validators: `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/scripts/validation/...`

- ✅ **Version Schema Section:** Enhanced with:
  - New story/epic progression rules (new story resets TASK and BUILD, new epic resets STORY, TASK, and BUILD)
  - Dev-kit epic ranges (Epic 1-4+)
  - Clarification that dev-kit has no legacy range (starts from Epic 1 with full schema)

- ✅ **Version Calculation Examples:** Added dev-kit-specific examples:
  - Epic 1 (AI Dev Kit Core), Story 1, Task 1: `0.1.1.1+1` → `0.1.1.1+2`
  - Epic 2 (Workflow Management Framework), Story 1, Task 2: `0.2.1.2+1`
  - Epic 3 (Numbering & Versioning Framework), Story 2: `0.3.2.1+1`
  - Epic 4 (Kanban Framework), Story 1, Task 1: `0.4.1.1+1`

- ✅ **Key Principles:** Added three critical principles from dev-kit versioning policy:
  - **Canonical Ordering:** Version numbers (not timestamps) determine changelog ordering
  - **Forensic Traceability:** Maintain complete traceability grid (version ↔ epic/story/task ↔ changelogs ↔ kanban ↔ git)
  - **Immutability:** Detailed changelog timestamps are immutable once written - never edit `**Release Date:**` field

- ✅ **Changelog Steps:** Enhanced Step 3 and Step 4 with:
  - Immutability notes (detailed changelog timestamps are immutable)
  - Clarification that main changelog date can be updated if merge date changes
  - Reference to two-layer timestamp system

- ✅ **Reference Documentation:** Added:
  - Kanban governance policy reference: `docs/project-management/rituals/policy/kanban-governance-policy.md`
  - Dev-kit versioning policy as canonical SoT reference

- ✅ **Customization Section:** Added "For ai-dev-kit Usage" subsection:
  - Dev-kit-specific paths for all file locations
  - Versioning policy reference (`docs/architecture/standards-and-adrs/dev-kit-versioning-policy.md` as canonical SoT)
  - Epic ranges information (Epic 1-4+, no legacy range)

### Key Documentation

**Alignment with Dev-Kit Policy:**
- All file paths now include dev-kit examples
- Version schema aligned with dev-kit epic ranges (1-4+)
- Principles aligned with dev-kit versioning policy (canonical ordering, forensic traceability, immutability)
- Changelog format aligned with two-layer timestamp system

**Template Readiness:**
- Template placeholders remain for other projects
- Dev-kit examples clearly tagged with `[Example: ai-dev-kit]`
- Clear distinction between template placeholders and dev-kit-specific usage

---

## 💡 Key Findings / Learnings

- The cursorrules section needed explicit dev-kit examples to show how the template works in the dev-kit repository itself.
- Adding dev-kit-specific principles (canonical ordering, forensic traceability, immutability) makes the template more complete and aligned with the dev-kit versioning policy.
- The "For ai-dev-kit Usage" subsection provides a clear reference for using the template in the dev-kit repo.
- Enhanced version schema section with new story/epic progression rules provides better guidance for version calculation.
