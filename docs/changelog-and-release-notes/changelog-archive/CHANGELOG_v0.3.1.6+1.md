**Epic / Story / Task:** Epic 3, Story 1, Task 6  
**Type:** 📚 Documentation

## 📋 Summary

This release completes **Task 6: Make .cursorrules abstract (remove hardcoded version numbers)**. The cursorrules RW trigger section has been abstracted to use template placeholders instead of hardcoded version numbers and project-specific paths, making it reusable across projects without requiring updates as work progresses.

## 📝 Notes

The cursorrules RW trigger section is now fully abstract and can be copied to other projects without requiring updates for hardcoded version numbers or project-specific paths. All examples teach the pattern rather than listing stale instances, and the file references canonical policy documents instead of duplicating schema details.
